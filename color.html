		<h1>Do Colors Have Opposites?</h1>
		<img src="RYB.png" height=300/>
		<p>
			In kindergarten art class, they show us a color wheel like this. They say that the colors that will contrast each other the strongest
			are across from each other, opposites: 
			<ul>
				<li>red and green</li>
				<li>orange and blue</li>
				<li>yellow and purple</li>
			</ul>
			But later on in physics class, they say all 
			color is different frequencies of light. Colors progress down the spectrum linearly, so how can they have opposites?

		<h3>How We Detect Color</h3>
		<p>
			The color sensing cones in our eyes come in 3 sensitivities, each specializing in detecting a different range of light frequencies.
			The peak sensitivities of these are red, green, and blue. 
			<br>
			<sub><sub>
				Note: While I had biases in the images I chose for this page, the fact that for the example below, there was so much variation 
				of whether cyan was included and just how the curves lined up, that many of them must be inaccurately aligned, not quite showing 
				the exact tone of light corresponding to the given frequency.
			</sub></sub>
		</p>

		<p>
			When we see 2 frequencies of light together, our brain processes them as the average of the 2. This is how pixels on screens 
			work. So while there is no single frequency of purple light, our minds assign mixed blue and red light a color, like it assigns a color
			to any other frequency or combination of frequencies. From these you can see that again the colors have been arranged circularly again, 
			but are the ones across from each other "opposite?"

		<h3>Additive Color</h3>
		<p>
			White light is how our brains interpret the average of all 3 frequencies together. When we overlap the colors like a venn diagram,
			you can see that the combinations equal a lack of the color across from them. 
			<ul>
				<li>cyan is all light but red</li>
				<li>magenta is all light but green</li>
				<li>yellow is all light but blue</li>
			</ul>
			In that way, these colors are opposites! Compare that to the standard color wheel!

		<h3>Light vs Pigment</h3>
		<p>
			So lets assume that the primary colors we use for light correspond to the colors each cone detects, and that is why they are primary.
			When objects are reflecting light and not generating it, the color they appear is the frequencies it does not absorb. This means the
			primary colors are inverse to light. If an object appears yellow (red and green) under white (red green blue) light, then if you shine it with 
			cyan (green and blue) light, it absorbs blue light to only reflect green.  This means that objects or pigments, which have a color
			in white light, will in some color of light reflect no color, appearing black.
