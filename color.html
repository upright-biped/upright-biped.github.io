			In kindergarten art class, they show us a color wheel like this. They say that the colors that will contrast 
			each other the strongest are across from each other, opposites: 
<!-- unordered list with 3 items -->
<!-- color names given their own color styles -->
			<ul>
				<li><span style="color:red"><b>red</b></span> and <span style="color:green"><b>green</b></span></li>
				<li><span style="color:orange"><b>orange</b></span> and <span style="color:blue"><b>blue</b></span></li>
				<li><span style="color:yellow"><b>yellow</b></span> and <span style="color:purple"><b>purple</b></span></li>
			</ul>
			But later on in physics class, we learn that color is different frequencies of light. Colors progress down the 
			spectrum linearly, so how can they have opposites?

		<h3>How We Detect Color</h3>
		
		<p>
			The color sensing cones in our eyes come in 3 sensitivities, each specializing in detecting a different range of
			light frequencies. The peak sensitivities of these are red, green, and blue. 
		<br>
			<sub><sub>
				Note: While I had biases in the images I chose for this page, the fact that for the example below, there 
				was so much variation of whether cyan was included and just how the curves lined up, that many of them 
				must be inaccurately aligned, not quite showing the exact tone of light corresponding to the given 
				frequency.
			</sub></sub>
		</p>

		<p>
			When we see 2 frequencies of light together, our brain processes them as the average of the 2. Pixels on 
			screens take advantage of this. Instead of changing the frequency of light, there are 3 lights which each 
			change their intensity. So while there is no single frequency of purple light, our minds assign mixed blue 
			and red light a color, like it assigns a color to any other frequency or combination of frequencies. From 
			these you can see that again the colors have been arranged circularly again, but are the ones across from 
			other "opposite?"

		<h3>Additive Color</h3>
		
		<p>
			White light is how our brains interpret the average of all 3 frequencies together. When we overlap the colors 
			like a venn diagram, you can see that the combinations equal a lack of the color across from them. This is most
			clear in the pixel image, where in the spots 2 colors overlap, you can see the missing space for the 3rd color.
			<ul>
				<li><span style="color:cyan"><b>cyan</b></span> is all light but <span style="color:red"><b>red</b></span></li>
				<li><span style="color:magenta"><b>magenta</b></span> is all light but <span style="color:lime"><b>green</b></span></li>
				<li><span style="color:yellow"><b>yellow</b></span> is all light but <span style="color:blue"><b>blue</b></span></li>
			</ul>
			In that way, these colors are opposites! Compare that to the standard color wheel!

		<h3>Light vs Pigment</h3>
		
		<p>
			So lets assume that the primary colors we use for light correspond to the colors each cone detects, and that is 
			why they are primary. When objects are reflecting light and not generating it, the color they appear is the 
			frequencies it does not absorb. This means the primary colors are inverse to light. If an object appears 
			<span style="color:yellow"><b>yellow</b></span>(
			<span style="color:red"><b>red</b></span> and 
			<span style="color:lime"><b>green</b></span>) under <b>white</b> (
			<span style="color:red"><b>red</b></span> 
			<span style="color:lime"><b>green</b></span> 
			<span style="color:blue"><b>blue</b></span>) 
			light, then if you shine it with 
			<span style="color:cyan"><b>cyan</b></span> (
			<span style="color:lime"><b>green</b></span> and 
			<span style="color:blue"><b>blue</b></span>) light, it 
			absorbs <span style="color:blue"><b>blue</b></span> light to only reflect 
			<span style="color:lime"><b>green</b></span>.  This means that objects or pigments, which have a color in white 
			light, will in some color of light reflect no color, appearing black.

			"Our world is saturated in color, from soft hues to violent stains. How does something so intangible pack such a 
			visceral punch? This hour, in the name of science and poetry, Jad and Robert tear the rainbow to pieces.
			<br><br>
			To what extent is color a physical thing in the physical world, and to what extent is it created in our minds? 
			We start with Sir Isaac Newton, who was so eager to solve this very mystery, he stuck a knife in his eye to 
			pinpoint the answer. Then, we meet a sea creature that sees a rainbow way beyond anything humans can experience, 
			and we track down a woman who we're pretty sure can see thousands (maybe even millions) more colors than the rest
			of us. And we end with an age-old question, that, it turns out, never even occurred to most humans until very 
			recently: why is the sky blue?"
		</p>

		<p>
			With what we learned so far, I'm skeptical that more cones = more colors, especially if the 4th cone stays within
			the same frequency range as the rest of us have. Its possible it allows someone to differentiate more shades if
			anything, but not colors beyond what those with normal color vision see. And tests say that mantis shrimp still
			have poor color vision despite their many many cones. 
			<br><br>
			But the interesting thing to me in this podcast is how it proposes that language may have shaped or been shaped 
			by our development of color vision, and and the possibility that the light of the sky may be completely different 
			to our brains than the rest of what we see in the world.
