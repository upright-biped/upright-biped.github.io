 THE LINCOLNS </p>        
	<p> Virgina holds dark secrets and one of them is held in a small western town.The year was around 1890 when an odd 
looking family who called themselves the Lincolns moved into town. They	did not look normal.They almost looked frog like.. About 10 years later one of the Lincolns
	sons attacked and killed the daughter of prominent local family. A mob then attacked him and dragged him to a field where he 
	was hung.At the girls funeral the Lincolns showed up so raged that the father threw a worm at the girls parents and yelled 
	"Here is your doom Later the parents of the girl where found dead ,and there where sightings of the young Lincoln boy around
	town. Later anyone who saw him went insane.A group of concerned townsfolk went to his grave to see if his body was still
	in the coffin ,but instead they found his corpse was gone.The next day the Lincoln family move out.Nobody new where they 
	moved to.Over the next years the town suffered lots of damage. It was almost like a curse had been put on them.
